Round Robin Project
John LeTard

Create Round Robin Pairing tables using the Crenshaw-Berger Method

Current Plans:

Version 1-  Just output a pairing table for as many sections as necessary

Version 2-  Create a method to track game results and scores

Version 3-  Add lookups for players based on their USCF ID #  possible also add lookup by Name to find USCF ID#

Version 4-  Create output files that can be uploaded to USCF for tournament rating
